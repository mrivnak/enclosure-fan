# enclosure-fan
Microcontroller software for controlling a 3D printer enclosure exhaust fan. Overcomplicated? Probably.

## Behavior
Connected with a 3-pole switch the fan can be 100% on, off, or on/off depending on enclosure temperature. This is for high-VOC materials like ABS, high-temp materials like nylon, and regular materials like PLA that don't like high enclosure temps, respectively.
